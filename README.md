## Riddles and Enigmas

I've tried my hand at writing riddles and enigmas (I hope that's what they're called).
Be warned, most of them require some knowledge of math and computer science lore.

<em>Some might be convoluted<br/>
Others might be straightforward.<br/>
Think for a couple minutes <br/>
Before seeking the answer.</em>

I have tried to maintain a consistent syllable count in all lines in each riddle.
Most of them will be decasyllabic, but some will be octasyllabic.
I will try in the future to adhere to some meter.
