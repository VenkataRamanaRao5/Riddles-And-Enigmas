He mounted the Elephant, deep in thought.
The first letter shows all relevant parts.
On his head was the crown of complex cross,
He gazed upon his equal straight across.
He saw companies of her add to files
Of the arrogant pride next to the crimes
Of she whom he once loved. But both were sameâ€”
A beautiful fact of eternal fame.
